### How to use:
On a Chrome browser, navigate to chrome://extensions, toggle Developer mode 'on' in the right-hand corner, then select the 'Load Unpacked' option in the left-hand corner.  One can then navigate to the directory that contains the Project_Zindagi folder to select that folder.  Then, the extension is available to use!  Just make sure that it is toggled on.  Navigate to the MyChart website to begin.

The biggest thing to make note of is that one *must* have a MyChart account in order to proceed with testing the product.  Please see the video demonstration in DevPost for how this extension works for the University of Virginia Health System's MyChart web interface.  If this product becomes commercialized and mass produced, the extension will need to come to accommodate various versions of MyChart across all the different institutions that use it!
